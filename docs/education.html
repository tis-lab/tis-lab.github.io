						<h3><a href="https://github.com/OHSUBD2K/">BD2K Open Educational Resources</a></h3>
						<p>Open Educational Resources covering various topics in data science are available in the form of online materials that are available <a href="https://github.com/OHSUBD2K/">here</a>, that are freely available to educators and students. This project was funded by an award to the <a href="http://www.ohsu.edu/library">OHSU Library</a> and the <a href=""http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/">Department of Medical Informatics & Clinical Epidemiology (DMICE)</a>, as part of the NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative, with the goal of improving health research by training students and researchers to better utilize and generate knowledge from large biomedical datasets.

						<h3><a href="https://biodata-club.github.io/">BioData Club</a></h3>
						<p>BioData Club is an informal, on-campus meetup initiated by a group of OHSU students, staff, and faculty. We come together to share skills, ask questions, and learn new open research tools. We believe anyone can learn to program and are happy to help you start from scratch! Join us to write your first line of code, learn new data management and analysis skills, try your hand at teaching in an informal context - or just show up at our Hacky Hour co-working events to work on your own projects with company.<br><br>
						<i>Funding:</i> Sponsored by the OHSU Library and OHSU DMICE.</p>
