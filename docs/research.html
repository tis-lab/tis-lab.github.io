					<h3><a href="https://covid.cd2h.org/N3C" class="logo">National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C)</a>
						</h3>
						<p>The National Center for Data to Health (CD2H) and NCATS are leading the creation of a centralized, secure portal for hosting row-level COVID-19 clinical data—called the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). This initiative is a partnership among several HHS agencies, the CTSA program, and the distributed clinical data networks PCORnet, OHDSI, ACT/i2b2, and TriNetX. The N3C will accept data via multiple data models and transform them into a common analytic model. The cloud-based collaborative portal will allow for the development of machine learning and other informatics tools that require a large row-level dataset, and will be overseen by a data access committee. We believe this portal will provide additional assets needed to rapidly develop the analytics that clinical centers and physicians need now. <b>Contact:</b> <a href="mailto:melissa@tislab.org">Melissa Haendel.</a><br><br>

					<h3><a href="https://monarchinitiative.org/" class="logo">Monarch Initiative</a>
						</h3>
						<p>Model systems are the cornerstone of biomedical research to investigate biological processes, test gene-based disease hypotheses, and develop and test disease treatments. The vast knowledge that we have about model systems can be better utilized if semantically aggregated and made queryable based on any number of facets, such as phenotypic similarity, network analysis, gene expression and function, and genomics. The Monarch Initiative aims to provide easy-to-use tools to navigate this data landscape, services for other resources, and educational outreach regarding the production of structured data for biomedical discovery. Monarch is a collaboration between members at Oregon Health & Science University, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, The Jackson Laboratory For Genomic Medicine, RTI International, Genomics England/Queen Mary, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, EBI, and Garvan Institute of Medical Research. <b>Contact:</b> <a href="mailto:mcmurryj@oregonstate.edu">Julie McMurry.</a><br><br>

						<h3><a href="http://bionlp-corpora.sourceforge.net/CRAFT/" class="logo">Annotating the CRAFT Corpus</a></h3>
						<p>The Colorado Richly Annotated Full-Text (CRAFT) Corpus is a collection of 97 full-length, open-access journal articles from the biomedical literature that are manually annotated, for use as gold-standard resources for the training and testing of biomedical Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. Within these articles, each mention of the concepts explicitly represented in eight prominent Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBOs) has been annotated, resulting in gold-standard markup of genes and gene products, chemicals and molecular entities, biomacromolecular sequence features, cells and cellular and extracellular components and locations, organisms, biological processes and molecular functionalities. With these ~100,000 concept annotations among the ~800,000 words in the 67 articles of the 1.0 release, it is one of the largest gold-standard biomedical semantically annotated corpora. In addition to this substantial conceptual markup, the corpus is fully annotated along a number of syntactic and other axes, notably by sentence segmentation, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, text formatting, and document sectioning. Current efforts are underway to add new annotations. <b>Contact:</b> <a href="mailto:vasilevs@ohsu.edu">Nicole Vasilevsky.</a><br><br>

						<h3><a href="http://ctsaconnect.org/" class="logo">CTSAconnect</a></h3>
						<p>The CTSAconnect project aimed to integrate information about research activities, clinical activities, and scientific resources by creating an Integrated Semantic Framework (ontology). This new framework facilitated the production and consumption of Linked Open Data (a Semantic Web method of sharing data) about investigators, physicians, biomedical research resources, services, and clinical activities. The goal was to enable software to consume data from multiple sources and allow the broadest possible representation of researchers' and clinicians' activities and research products. Current research tracking and networking systems rely largely on publications, but clinical encounters, reagents, techniques, specimens, model organisms, etc., are equally valuable for representing expertise. CTSAconnect was a collaboration between members at OHSU, Stony Brook University, Cornell University, Harvard University, University at Buffalo, and the University of Florida, and leveraged the work of eagle-i, VIVO, and ShareCenter.  <b>Contact:</b> <a href="mailto:vasilevs@ohsu.edu">Nicole Vasilevsky.</a><br><br>

						<h3><a href="https://www.force11.org/group/resource-identification-initiative" class="logo">Resource Identification Initiative</a></h3>
						<p>The Resource Identification Initiative (#RII) was designed to help researchers sufficiently cite the key resources used to produce the scientific findings reported in the biomedical literature. The project aimed to enable resource identification within the biomedical literature through a pilot study promoting the use of unique Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs). In addition to being unique, RRID’s meet three key criteria, they are: 1) Machine readable; 2) Free to generate and access; 3) Consistent across publishers and journals. A diverse group of collaborators led the project, including the Neuroscience Information Framework and the OHSU Library. <b>Contact:</b> <a href="mailto:vasilevs@ohsu.edu">Nicole Vasilevsky.</a></p>
						<i>Funding:</i> The Resource Identification Initiative was supported by the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a> and the <a href="https://neuinfo.org//">INCF.</a></p>

						<h3>Biospecimen Query</h3>
						<p>This project explored options for enhancing search capabilities for an existing biospecimen search application. Text processing tools were used to map anatomy, pathology, and disease concepts from existing terminologies and ontologies to pathology reports that are currently represented in an unstructured natural text form. The concepts identified in the text were also organized in a relational structure to enable taxonomic and parthood based searches. This was a small exploratory project with a goal of integrating these capabilities in an ongoing effort to expand and integrate OHSU's biospecimen databases. <b>Contact:</b> <a href="mailto:melissa@tislab.org">Melissa Haendel.</a><br><br>
